VDH CoApp is not being developed anymore - VDH v10 doesn't require a companion. After updating the Video DownloadHelper browser extension, the vdhcoapp package can safely be deleted.

The Video DownloadHelper Companion App has been installed on your machine. However, it still needs to be registered before the Video DownloadHelper browser extension can use it.

Commands:
  vdhcoapp install	# register browser JSON files in browser-specific locations.
  vdhcoapp uninstall	# remove JSON files.

Options:
  --help	# display commands and options
  --info	# list extra info from converter
  --version	# show coapp version
  --user	# force installation in user mode (automatic if run as non-root user)
  --system	# force installation system wide (automatic if run as root user)
